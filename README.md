# 📝 ProNote

**ProNote** is a collaborative notes application built for productivity, organization, and focus. Designed as a full-stack project using **Next.js** (frontend) and **Django** (future backend), ProNote allows users to take control of their notes, habits, tasks, and diaries — with a unique focus on **collaboration through tags**.
